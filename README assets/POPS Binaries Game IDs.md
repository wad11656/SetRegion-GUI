## POPS Binaries Game IDs
"POPS" is the name of the PS1 emulator on PSP & Vita. Sometimes a new version of POPS was released alongside a PSP firmware update. (These releases correspond with the PSP firmware versions you see listed in the POPSLoader plugin.) When the POPS binaries (called `pops.prx`) were decrypted and opened in a hex editor, the PSP homebrew scene discovered various Game IDs buried within the hex, one of which being the ever-so-helpful `SLPS-01222`.

It's theorized that all (or most) of the Game IDs found in the hex are patched in some way in POPS. Therefore, it might be worth trying these Game IDs in PSX2PSP when searching for a fix for your game. If you're on PSP, don't forget to combine the Game IDs with different POPS versions (if they don't work on FW 6.60/6.61); game IDs behave differently on different POPS versions.
