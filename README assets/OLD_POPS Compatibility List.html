<p>Here is a pops compatibility list please add to it by leaving a comment if you can help with the list.</p>
<p align="center"><strong>PSX to PSP GLOSSARY</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>  <strong>Pops</strong>&nbsp;= The in-built PSX emulator for the PSP, developed by&nbsp;Sony. Each&nbsp;firmware&nbsp;has it’s own, though some share the same binary.</p>
<p>  <strong>Popsloader</strong>&nbsp;= A plugin use to load different versions of pops.</p>
<p>  <strong>Keys.bin&nbsp;</strong>= When you download a PSOne Classic form the PSN store, it comes with keys.bin and it’s required for the game to run. The old popstations generate one, but this is not required anymore with the newer popstations.</p>
<p>  <strong>Document.dat</strong>&nbsp;= The game manual, which also comes PSOne Classics from the playstation store. You can&nbsp;make your own&nbsp;custom game manual with PSP DocMaker GUI.</p>
<p>  <strong>GAME ID</strong>&nbsp;= The identification number used by Sony. Typically this is on the Playstation CD in a file named with the region code plus the unique number for each disk. For example, SLUS-00972 tells you it was shipped to the United States.</p>
<p>  <strong>PSOne Classic</strong>&nbsp;= Also referred to as “PSN versions”, these PSX games available for purchase via the&nbsp;Playstation NetworkStore. These versions don’t require Popsloader, most work fine as long as you’re on the latest&nbsp;firmware. </p>

<td>If you use the   default GameID it will freeze after the "Chapter 1" screen. So use   one of the GameID’s below. <br>
   When   you do use one of these gameIDs you’ll sometimes notice a little slowdown or   some stuttering in voices, but at least the game works. <b>3.52 and below:</b>   Use GameID SLPS-01156, SLPS-01724, or SLPS-01222. <br>

   <b>3.90:</b> Only GameID SLPS-01156 will work.   Also the slowdown and stuttering in voices is <i>slightly</i> better. EBOOT   needs to be made with CDDA Popstation 1.24 (don’t forget, you’ll need   keys.bin). Many GUIs make bad eboots… <br>
   <b>3.90</b> Works perfect for me with   SLPS-01156, eboot made with Simple Popstation GUI 3.00 and 01156 ID was   patched onto the eboot after – DebugJunky <br>
   <b>4.01:</b> If you use GameID <b>SLPS-01490</b>   then gameplay and voices are MUCH better. However if you try to watch the   opening cinematic after starting a new game it will freeze at a black screen   after it zooms in on the castle. So press Start as soon as you can to skip   it. <br>
   <b>5.00:</b> GameID SLPS-01490 and SLPS-01156   doesn’t work, game gets stuck on black screen and doesn’t even show the PS   logo. If you use the default SLUS-00726 GameID the game will boot, but it   will freeze after zooming in on the castle and after the "Chapter   1" screen. <br>
   <b>5.00m33-6:</b> Works perfectly (no slowdown,   stutter, or freezes that I have seen so far up through chapter 2), looks, and   sounds the best on 3.03 when using GameID SLPS-01156. -Sincerely, X. <b>UPDATE:</b>Only   seems to work if the EBOOT is created with Popstation GUI 300 BETA. <br>

   <b>6.20   PRO B-9:</b> Converted using   Simple POPstation GUI 3.00 BETA and using 3.40 via POPSLOADER, tried using   PSX2PSP but got the Chapter 1 freeze screen using that.

   andwan0 –   SLUS-00484, freezes in Act 3, Paris hospital, CFW 3.10, 3.40, 3.72. Well   actually, when I tried CFW 3.40 again, it appears that scene just runs very   very slow. I left it running and it does still run.. after like 5-10 minutes.   I just quickly try to get past that screen/stage and into the hospital room   to speak to the guy to carry on with the storyline. I manage to get past that   bit and never needed to return. Also, in Egypt or Ciaro there’s some graphic   background clitches. Again, this doesn’t stop the game from playing. The only   WORST part is trying to pick up the soap in the bathroom. Apparently this is   a pixel hunt… and using the PS directional pad is a pain since it has a   constant sensitivitiy…</td>

<td>This game does not   let you save before changing discs, so you are going to have to either use a patch made by   Psychospacefish,   CWcheat, or create a multidisc EBOOT with popstation_md   (only works on 3.71-4 m33 or higher) <br>

   <b>5.00   M33-6</b> Most of the game   works fine. Using certain spells such as Full Life, and Bio, freeze the game.   All FMV’s work. Made EBOOT with Popstation GUI 3.00. Tested by Roxas6662. <br>
   <b>5.50   GEN-B</b> Followed   instruction found under "Another Note" in FF VIII page. Compiled   multi disc eboot using RS-GUI and used GameID SLPS-02180 to remove the   problems of cast/draw locking. YOU MUST USE 3.80/3.72/3.71 POPS to get though   the FMVs in the game. You can use 3.71/3.72/3.80 through entire game but   there is major slowdown in some battles and when junctioning GFs and Magic   along with sound problems in battles. Use 3.90 POPS to run game at full speed   and just switch to 3.80/3.72/3.71 when you need to get though an FMV. – Mikey   – <br>

  Minor sound glitches during some model-based battle scenes on 3.71 M33-3 by   MonkeyJamboree. <p></p>
<p>
  <b>3.80 M33-5:</b>Plays perfectly except for minor graphic problems in 2   FMV’s (When queen Brahne summons Bahamut (Disc 2?), and Zidane in the lifa   tree (Disc 4)). Eboots created with Alcohol 120% and popstation GUI V 3 beta   by ZiNgA BuRgA </p>
<p>
  <b>3.90:</b>Opening FMV played for me, however there was no sound. I copied   the game with Alcohol 52%, then made the eboot with PSX2PSP v1.3. </p>
<p>
  <b>3.90 m33-3 Slim:</b> The second FMV that plays after Pinnacle Rock (With   Zidane and Dagger running through the field towards Lindblum) is like the   opening FMV, as it has no sound. – G_S </p>
<p>
  <b>Confirmation:</b> 3.90 M33-3 Plays the intro FMV with no sound   irrespective of programs used to copy/convert to eboot. Additionally the FMV   at the start of the festival can bug out and make a loud buzzing sound. Other   than that works perfect. -Vanit </p>
<p>
  <b>4.01 M33-2:</b> Opening FMV played from the first disk (and probably   single disk eboots) has no sound, however you can get the sound to play by   switching to one of the later disks and selecting New Game. It’ll ask you to   put in the first disc. After switching disks it’ll start the FMV with all of   the sound. This probably won’t help any for the later FMV, though. -Ganoran<br>
  <b>5.00 M33-3</b> With a multi-disc Eboot when you start a new game, the   screen goes black and locks up. With a single disc Eboot, the opening movie   has no sound but the game plays fine so far.<br>

  <b>5.00 M33-4</b> Well, i ripped from my NTSC-U black discs in perfect   condition with latest imageburn, and the game played fine as a single-disc   eboot. Just like the orginal, the intro played fine. With sound. And all   other FMVs too. Worked perfect. Converted with PSX2PSP v1.4.2. //Pojkflickan </p>

   <b>5.00   M33-4</b> As a single disc   eboot load in 3.80 pops and game runs perfectly so far. I’m in Gizamaluke’s   Grotto with no problems with the gameplay. There is barely noticeable lag in   music during the entering a battle sequence and putting your PSP into suspend   mode while the game is running and turning it back on freezes your PSP. Eboot   made with POPstation GUI 3.00 Beta By RagnaBlade47 </p>
<p>
  <b>5.00 M33-4:</b>Using single disc eboots in the default Popsloader (from flash   so 5.00), it’s very much playable. The opening sequence had no sound but   everything else was fine. There are some minor sound and lag issues during   opening/closing menus but its barely noticeable. Also, the scene when   Alexandria is attacked by Bahamut, the sound got stuck but the video played   fine. I found battle lags more in forest areas for some reason especially   magic casting. Other than that, I’ve had no other problems and I’m on Disc 4   but I’ll update if it changes. //Lufie101 <br>
  <b>Update:</b>At the end of Disc 4, the game froze right after walking in   space. I was in a battle with the crystallized of the elemental bosses and   cast Quake and it froze. I switched the Popsloader to 4.01 and it worked fine   to the end of the game (FMVs and all). <br>
   <b>5.00   M33-6</b> Using popstation   to load 3.80 emulation, settings Normal, Normal, +2, Fast, everything seems   to be all right on all discs, movies play with sound. If you have problems in   game, swap out Fast for Normal. </p>
<p>  <b>5.00 M33-6</b> Played through all 4 discs on multidisk eboot made with   First Multi-Disc Popstation GUI by akadewboy. Works 100% (including through   all side quests), without a single crash. Used Fast for disc load speed.   -Tikaszar </p>
<p>  <b>5.00 M33-6</b> Using a multidisk EBOOT, if you reset the game and load a   disc other than disc 1, and try to start a new game, it will ask you to   change discs. After you change discs to disc 1 the opening FMV will have   sound. -SlimJimGuyMan </p>

  Using <b>3.90</b> pops on my 5.00 m33-6 PSP with disc load speed set to fast,   my EBOOT worked fine and had sound on the intro FMV, I used PSX2PSP 1.4.2 to   convert mint .img disc images, used compression level 4, I have no idea why   me EBOOT works fine and has sound on the intro and others’ don’t… –   DebugJunky </p>
<p>   <b>GEN   5.50-D3</b> Using Debug   Junkies method of making the multidisc EBOOT seems to work flawlessly. Using   PSX2PSP make sure your compression level is set to 4 and hit convert.

<td>From Mallard: Due   to a bug, the game crashes (freezes) through the battles, when the <br>
   HP   of the Wanzer legs is 0 (player or enemy). It happens with a chance of 98%   during the battle-animations … <img src="./OLD_POPS Compatibility List_files/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" class="wp-smiley">  <br>
   So   it would be wise to make a battle save with every turn and to avoid direct   attacks to an opponent with Leg HP = 0. Missle attacks and attacks with   Flamethrowers will work much better. <br>
   Aside   of that, there are no other problems (i played the game 25 hours up to now). <br>
   <b>From   Reifnir:</b> Possibly resolved   leg audio issue by setting EBOOT compression to none. (Setup: PSX2PSP 1.2,   Slim 3.71 M33-2, not using popsloader) Played several hours into the game and   have only crashed once. Everything looks pretty good. <br>
   <b>From   Ryouru:</b> No bugs verified   when playing from flash on 5.00 m33-3. Game crashs and my PSP shuts down   when, after the Ba Kui Dam battle, you choose the Xinzhu path, rather than   the Yingko path(15~20 hours of gameplay). Even with compression level at none   the issue remains. <br>
   <b>From   TheFilipinoChannel:</b>   After the Yingko path battle, the game stops loading (unlike what Ryouru   mentioned, the PSP remains OK) when you reach the Rural Village in Taiwan.   The Xinzhu path is still broken. Played on ‘original from flash’ in firmware   5.00 M33-4 on PSP fat. Even the lower POPS (versions which i couldn’t   remember) do the same thing. Dec/17/2008 <br>
   <b>From   Druids1974:</b>   Don’t start at all on 5.00m33-3 <br>
   <b>From   GamerbyDesign:</b>   I’ve been playing on the Fat PSP with firmware 5.00 M33-6 for about 11 hours   now. The game boots fine and I have not experienced the 0 HP Leg bug. However   I did find an issue in the mission choice after the Ba Kui Dam. If you choose   Xinzhu the PSP will show the loading screen but then stay black. <br>
   <b>From   Jeety:</b>No leg issues, no   problems on both Yingko and Xinzhu paths, All Working perfectly so   far(5.00M33-6 original from flash, PSP Slim). I must be pretty lucky. <br>
   <b>From   realitor:</b>   Playing on a PSP-3000 with 5.03 GEN-C loaded, using original from flash. Game   runs flawlessly. No 0 hp leg bug. Eboot created using PSX2PSP 1.2   (uncompressed). </td>

   <b>UPDATE:</b> I got past the previous   contributor’s freeze by using <b>3.40</b> <br>
   <b>UPDATE   13/02/2009 – Bad Mr Frosty</b><br>
  This is a bit of a pain to get working. As mentioned above, the game tends to   freeze after playing ingame engine generated cutscenes (prerendered CGI   cutscenes do not cause the game to freeze) Here is what I did:<p></p>
<p>  1. Create single disc eboots AND a multi disk eboot.<br>
  2. Start the game from the single disc eboot for disc one using POPS 3.52 (I   could not even get the game to boot using 3.40 mentioned above)<br>
  3. Play until the end of disc 1. There is a save point just before the disc   switch, save here.<br>
  4. Quit the game and start up the multi disk eboot using POPS 3.72<br>
  5. Load up your save (the multi eboot and the single eboot for disc 1 have   the same ID`s so the saves are shared) and continue playing, switching disks   to disc 2 when promted.<br>
  5. I was able to play the game from the multi disc eboot using firmware 3.72   for the entire second disk without it freezing.<br>
  6. When you reach disc 3, save the game and quit (Otherwise the game will   freeze right after the cutscene where Koudelka finds Edward and James behind   the big metal door)<br>
  7. Boot up the single disc eboot for disc 3 in POPS 5.00. Go to the memory   card management section from the HOME menu and import your save from the   multi disk eboot.<br>
  8. Quit and reload disk 3 in POPS 3.52 and play until the end of the 3rd disc<br>
  9. Quit and reload the multidisk eboot in POPS 5.00, import the save from   disc 3. Play until after the disc switch, save and quit<br>
  10. Boot up the single disc eboot for disc 4 in POPS 5.00. Go to the memory   card management section from the HOME menu and import your save from the   multi disk eboot.<br>
  11. Quit and reload disk 4 in POPS 3.52 and play until the end of the game</p>
<p>  <b>UPDATE ~ 18/7/2009 – Verdeni</b> Give it the GameID SCUS94640 (Syphon   Filter 3) The Whole game plays without freezing, multidisk eboot AND single.   Tested on 3.52 pops.</p>
<p>  <b>Update:</b> Tested on both 5.00 M33-6 and 5.50 GEN-D2… IMPOSSIBLE to   play a multiple-disc eboot without freezes and glitches, regardless of pops.   I don’t know what the above guy is smoking but 3.52 doesn’t support   multiple-disc games. The only pops that can run this game without issues is   3.30. Play a single-disc eboot and if you like it buy the game, or find out   how to switch discs on PSP.</p>
<p>  <b>UPDATE 31/8/2011</b> Multi-disk eboot seems to work fine now with 6.60   pops. Tested on 6.60 PRO-B9 without the popsloader plugin. </p></td>

<td>Minor sound   deterioration during battles; resolved by saving and restarting on 3.71   m33-3, the sound deterioration disappears, but you get a black screen at   parts. Seems to happen at the same spots. <br>
   While   playing on 3.71 you’ll get a blackscreen after Lenus fight. Update to 3.80   and it will run fine. Also use popsloader to emulate other firmwares, so you   can change back, because there will be more blackscreens and you’ll need to   change firmware back to 3.71. (At least, that worked for me). <br>
   Works   perfectly on my 3.90 m33-2!! <br>
   People   have found that if you don’t turn into a Dragoon during the Lenus fight then   it wont freeze. (yes she’s hard, but you don’t want to risk it freezing, so   don’t change into your Dragoons.) <br>
   -Above   poster is definately correct but also on single-disc eboot you can go to 3.03   pops to get through that fight then save and switch pops back after –   DebugJunky <br>

REAL heavily,   that is. I didn’t hear one flawless conversation in about an hour of playing.   Didn’t change the Game-ID to SLPM-86114 tough. – LiquidSnakE <br>
   <b>5.00   M33-6</b> Used the same   multidisc eboot and SLPM-86114 as Game-ID – playable, but has the same   stuttering issue. – LiquidSnakE <br>
   <b>5.00   M33-6 (POPS 3.90)</b>   Fixes the stutter issue in all breifing videos, codec also seams perfectly   stable, no glitches so far, Multiboot with SLMP86114, made with psx2psp   converter, may update after more gameplay if any issue appears – KK1N5@N3 <br>
   SLPM86115   works for fixing the audio glitches as well, I used this instead as I used   the SLPM86114 ID on Metal Gear Solid: Integral to fix the audio glitches,   using different IDs for these two means their savedata won’t be saved to the   same folder and won’t merge when you view them on your mem stick on PSP. –   DebugJunky <br>

<td><b>5.50 GEN-D3</b> seems to work, if like me you used   original game ID (SLES-01370 for disc 1, SLES-11370 for disc 2) it will have   the same codec audio glitches and minor graphic stutters during cutscenes the   NTSC version had, then try using SLES01734 (spanish ID i think) and it seems   to have sorted the audio out so far.

Will seem to hang at black screen after PS logo when   loading from Disc 1, but will load just fine if left alone for about one   minute. Disc change and save recognition work fine – Azure Fang<br>
  <b>5.50 GEN-D2</b> Multidisk EBOOT,no popsloader, just stick it in   x:\PSP\Game\Parasite Eve(or your preferred folder name) and go on your merry   way. Will freeze after the Playstation logo appears, easily fixed by setting   disk load speed to fast (Credit all goes to Azure Fang above for quelling my   anger at a black screen all night XD). It runs smoothly all the way through   but when you beat the game, it’s over, because after the credits, it’s black   screen town all the way. Sorry Crystler Tower!!! – Zyphr the Gray </td>

   Room   5 and the Loft may be unlocked for a short while before you should be able to   enter them (before obtaining the Master Key). Entering Room 5 without the   Master Key leads to some kind of rendering test room with no textures (may be   worth a look, but don’t save after entering). Entering either room will cause   Room 6 to be locked later on, which makes it impossible to continue the game   if the huge ANMC in Dryfield smashes the walkway. <br>
   To   proceed to Disc 2, save game immediately after defeating Number 9 in   Dryfield, save game in Douglas’s trailer or Motel Room 6 and reload using   Disc 2. Reloading in Motel Lobby freezes at loading screen. <br>

   <b>5.00   M33-6</b>: Works just fine   on single disc eboot. Currently on disc 2 so I have to test a multi-disc   eboot with psx2psp using game ID SLPS-02480 and pops 4.01. Have fun!! <img src="./OLD_POPS Compatibility List_files/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" class="wp-smiley">    <br>
   <b>5.00   M33-6</b> Will not boot   using pops from flash but works fine with pops 4.01, fast disc-load, as   multi-disc eboot as mentioned above. Small graphical error with Kyle floating   in the air during dialogue after SDI system fires on the bunker, but I think   that was on disc as well. -Azure Fang <br>
   <b>PSP-3K   with 5.03 GEN-A via ChickHEN</b>   SLPS-00025 would only work as a single disc eboot with pops 3.10/3.11. No FMV   glitches, but I was caught out by the Motel Room 6 glitch mentioned above   (even though I didn’t enter room 5 or the loft prior to that). Froze once   when using Combustion and occasionally wouldn’t recognise memory card as   well. <br>
   Experimented   for a while and found that SLPS-02480 worked as a multi-disc eboot on pops   4.01 IF compression (converted with PSX2PSP 1.4) was low. At level 9, froze   at Square EA screen (level 1 still compressed to 23% anyway, the same as   level 9). If disc speed is on high, this can cause the publisher screen   freeze (and possibly hang when loading rooms as well). Played through first   disc so far and swapped to disc 2 without any problems. Will update when (if)   game is completed. <br>
   With   regards to the Motel Room 6 glitch, I recommend saving in the MIST garage   before you leave for Dryfield. Upon arrival, go up to Motel Room 6. If it   lets you enter, your game’s borked as you won’t get the cut-scene with   Douglas in the garage and won’t receive the key to the room. After the fight   with the huge ANMC you’ll be trapped upstairs. Reload from the MIST garage   and try again. – Gojiratron <br>
   Note   for home rips: Some US copies of disc 2 (SLUS-01055) use intentional bad   sector copy protection which will abort some tools like Alcohol 120% with an   unexpected/unrecoverable read error. If you run into this issue use CloneCD   to create the .img for conversion. Completed raw playthrough, full + Pierce   scenario, no problems. Will update if anything arises during future/secondary   mode playthroughs – Azure Fang </td>

   <b>4.01m33-2</b> – SLPS-00025 is not effective. Game   still freezes at publisher screen, but this could be due to the game being a   multi-disc eboot. And if it is, then Parasite Eve 2 [PAL] can not be played   in multi-disc eboot format, period, since older pops, namely 3.40 pops, can’t   run multi-disc eboots and it’s the only version of pops that currently runs   Parasite Eve 2 [PAL].</td>

<td>I used <b>4.01</b>   POPS with GameID <b>SLPS-02825</b>, which comes from the japanese version of   the game. You must create the EBOOT using PSX2PSP, otherwise the game won’t   even start with the 4.01 POPS. There is no lag, even when there’s a lot of   text onscreen. Also, by using this ID, you won’t have to share the memory   cards with Innocent Sin saves. The rare random crashes in battle persist even   with this ID, <b>but you can HEAVILY decrease the freeze frequency by setting   the Disc Speed to fast</b>. I also used no compression when making my eboot,   I don’t know if that helps too. I had over a dozen freezes in my first 20   hours while using a compressed ISO and the normal Disc Speed, especially   during boss battles. After setting the Disc Speed to fast and removing the   ISO compression, I had only 3 crashes in over 20 hours of gameplay, and none   during a boss fight. I beat the final boss without problems. Hope it helps!   -by Sephiroth1311<br>

During the train boss battle with   Birkin on Claire Scenario B the game will freeze if you stay too close to the   train door-solution: go to the opposite side of the train and fight him   there, once the battle is over there is no danger of freezing(Note: this is   on a two eboot none multi disc version it may be different on multi disc.)

   <b>3.90:</b> Both disk 1 and 2 freeze at Violence   Warning screen on SLPS-01222. Leon/Claire A Scenarios (Disk 1) works   perfectly using <b>SLPS-01510</b>, but B Scenarios freeze at random points   when going up stairs or ladders in the police station. <br>

   <b>5.00   M33-6/5.50 GEN-B2:</b>   Works very fine, exactly as xFrostx said, <b>BUT</b> there is a <b>VERY   IMPORTANT MISSING DETAIL</b> that it cost me a lot of time! Here it is: To   prevent the game to freeze at violence warning screen, when creating the   EBOOT.PBP file <b>DO NOT FORGET to change each one of the disks IDs <u>TOGETHER   WITH</u> the Main Game ID!</b> To make it easier, just follow this: before   clicking the ‘Convert’ button at the ‘whatever-program-you-are-using’   interface, make sure you have changed the Main Game ID to <b>SLPS-01222</b>,   the Disk #1 (Leon) ID to <b>SLPS-01222</b> and finally, the Disk #2 (Claire)   ID to <b>SLPS-01223</b>. My advice: use PSX2PSP v1.4.2 to do this, as far I   know, no other program allows you to adjust the IDs like this one. If you   bypass this step or change only the Main Game ID, the game will freeze at the   violence warning screen for sure! I’m using firmware 5.00 M33-6, with   POPsloader 3.90 and the game is running flawless now! By the way, this same   information is also valid to the RE2 without Dual Shock support. Enjoy the   game! <img src="./OLD_POPS Compatibility List_files/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley">  – <b>Updated Info:</b> I’ve updated my PSP to 5.50 GEN-B2 and   still works very fine.

<td><b>5.00 M33-6 WORKS   PERFECTLY!!(Up to 1st Save Point, at least. This way you could – in theory –   save it and then use any of the compiled EBOOTs that normally crash after the   loading screen.)</b>   Compiled EBOOT.PBP file using Zinga’s Simple Popstation GUI 3 BETA – It goes   to the black screen after the introduction video, and after testing different   theories I found a few ways to get it to work, this was the most efficient   (No guarantee this will work for you, best chances to get these to work are   to compile your EBOOT using Zinga’s Simple Popstation GUI v3 beta): The way I   do it is by pressing MENU, then selecting More Options/Other Options and   changing DISK LOAD SPEED to FAST. I find that tapping MENU to pop the MENU up   and down, improves the success rate of this(my friend’s PSP only loads it   when I change disk load speed AND tap MENU)- Then Go back and it should load   up the GAME MENU. My suggestion is to get to a save point and svae it ASAP.   Beats the black screen on new game, which could come in handy. Keep a copy   and you won’t have to worry about that problem next time.<br>
   <b>Important!</b> Use SLPS-01222 (BioHazard 2 Game ID)   to avoid Clock Tower game freeze. To avoid game freeze after getting the   firehose, instead of going directly to the alley, go back to the parking lot   to deposit the hose in the chest. Now go directly to the alley (without the   fire hose) and then there you withdraw the hose skipping the door where the   game freezes.<br>

Another occurs if   you press start from the weapon choice menu, and one more if you skip the   animation after beating Cervantes (just the first time, but in subsequent   times you need at least a bit of the animation to play).

   Acquired   the original psx game, used Ultra ISO to make .Bin and .Cue, loaded the Cue   into Popstation Gui 3 to convert into eboot (to have audio tracks in-game).   Ran the game with 4.01 pops. Runs well, no crashes seen beyond level 1. <p></p>

</ul>
<p>
   Loading   game: Two instability crashes. One involves not switching the memory card   before choosing a save, the other involves save 1. <br>
   Before   choosing Save 2, you must first press the Circle button to switch from memory   card 1 to 2, and then back to 1. <br>
   There   are 3 save sections per memory card. Save 1 causes the game to crash on load.   (DO NOT USE) Save 2 allows the game to load (USE) – by MEGAXSTU/StriderH2 </p></td>

Switching to 5.00 solved the latter problem.

<td>First form Deus has   an attack that locks game. (beat him quickly)<br>
   A   PSN version is out now, which does not have the Deus glitch anymore. <br>
   <b>3.52   m33:</b> May freeze during   the "Old Movie Countdown" scene. Use 3.40 if this happens. <br>
   There’s   no need to beat Deus quickly, you only must wait his attack wich drops his   energy and yours at 50%, but do not fear, that attack do not kill anybody,   then wait until his energy (and maybe yours) is below of 1000 HPs then use   System ID with Fei and attack with X button, that attack should kill Deus, is   important that you don’t attack Deus before, if you do, then Deus will   counterattack with the attack that freeze the game.

   On   5.50gen-d3 using POPS <b>3.72</b>, same as above. <br>

   <b>5.00m33-6:</b> Using 3.71 pops worked fine other   than 1st form Deus. I tried waiting for his 1/2 HP attack (he needs to use it   3 times before you can beat him with System ID) but he seems to randomly   cycle through 3 attacks even if you don’t attack him. 1 of those attacks   locks up the game every time, not just on the PSP, but on PS2′s and PC   emulators as well. I had to use my PS3 to copy the save file to a Memory Card   and use my PS1 to beat him, then copy the save file back to my PSP after.   –Phane <br>
